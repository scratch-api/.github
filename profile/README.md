# scratch-api

This is a GitHub organisation that hosts some projects relating to [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). The goal was to reserve `@scratchattach` but it was already taken, so it is currently called `@scratch-api`. However this does not matter, as the display name can be changed at any time, to anything.

This is NOT the scratchattach organization (there is none). But it aims to collate the various scratch api projects. Some may move here (like scratchattach.ts), but others will just be linked below.
This may also, in the future, include a docs section on the scratch api, to give a list of things to implement if you want to make a scratch api client in a different language.

If you want to add more to this list, just open a pull request [on the repository](https://github.com/scratch-api/.github) that hosts [this file](https://github.com/scratch-api/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md).
