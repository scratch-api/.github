# scratch-api

This is a (currently) empty GitHub organisation. The goal was to reserve `@scratchattach` but it was already taken, so it is currently called `@scratch-api`.

For now, this is not official. But it aims to collate the various scratch api projects. Some may move here (like sa.ts), but others will just be linked.
This may also, in the future, include a docs section on the scratch api, to give a list of things to implement if you want to make a scratch api client in a different language.
